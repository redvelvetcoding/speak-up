          <p class="you">Dear you,<br>We want you to know that you are not alone. You are not weak and you are capable of
            healing.
            Below are stories of survivors who have gone through more or less of what you are going through. These
            people decided to SPEAK UP. We hope that you will be inspired by their stories.<br>You are strong, you are a
            survivor.</p>

        <div class="big">
           <h2 class="fe">ANONYMOUS. Age:39. Female</h2>

            <p class="up">Growing up, I was taught to keep secrets.<br> I can't remember the exact age that I was first
                sexually
                abused by my father, but I remember that he would come to my room at night, telling me that he loves me
                before touching me.When I was around the age of 8 to 9, he would beat me before performing his acts
                on me.<br>I tried to tell my mum, but she told me to keep quiet. I thought something was wrong with me for
                me to deserve this.<br> I battled with trust and low self esteem because of these issues. My first step
                of healing started when I decided to speak up, I realised that I've been carrying a big weight on my
                shoulder.<br>To everyone out there, please come forward, speak up. Owning your story is the bravest
                thing you will ever do.</p>
        </div>

       <div class="big2">
             <h2 class="fe">ANONYMOUS. Age:53. Male</h2>
            <p class="up2">Deal with it, you are a guy.<br> As a victim of abuse, I have been torn inside out. I tried
                to work it
                out myself because people won't believe me. They said I am a guy and I probably enjoyed it. My mental
                health had deteriorated to the point where I was thinking of giving up and ending everything. <br>I
                found this platform and I am so glad that I am able to speak up freely without any form of judgement.
                There is help, there is healing and there is hope.</p>
        </div>

       <div class="big3">
             <h2 class="fe">ANONYMOUS. Age:24 Female</h2>
            <p class="up2">Sometimes, we are not free to make our choices in life.<br> It was certainly not my choice that my drink
                was spiked with LSD by someone I considered to be my best friend. It was not my choice that she decided
                to use me as a bet with her other friends. It was also not my choice that I was gang raped because I
                decided to trust my friend. Forgetting is difficult, remembering is worse.<br>They took my worth, my
                privacy, my confidence but not my voice. I've decided to speak up and it is the first step in my healing
                journey.</p>
